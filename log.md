# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1:  January 1st, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Wrote an algorithm to convert a base 10 number into a binary number.  It prints it as a string, calculates the highest streak of '1's in a row, and re-outputs the base-10 number using calculations to make sure it was done correctly.  
**Thoughts**:  All of it happens in the console right now, but I am hoping to add a visual display next.  I struggled hard on the best way to figure out how to tell the highest number of times in a row a number repeated.

### Day 0: Date (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
