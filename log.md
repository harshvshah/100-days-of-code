# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1:  January 1st, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Wrote an algorithm to convert a base 10 number into a binary number.  It prints it as a string, calculates the highest streak of '1's in a row, and re-outputs the base-10 number using calculations to make sure it was done correctly.  
**Thoughts**:  All of it happens in the console right now, but I am hoping to add a visual display next.  I struggled hard on the best way to figure out how to tell the highest number of times in a row a number repeated.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: learned more bootstrap layout more intensely, helped a friend get his setInterval() commands working.  displayed the trivia game page using mostly bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Still really struggling with bootstrap, however javascript is feeling very strong these days.  (i did struggle with reusing my recursive shuffle method in a different situation)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
