# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1:  January 1st, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Wrote an algorithm to convert a base 10 number into a binary number.  It prints it as a string, calculates the highest streak of '1's in a row, and re-outputs the base-10 number using calculations to make sure it was done correctly.  
**Thoughts**:  All of it happens in the console right now, but I am hoping to add a visual display next.  I struggled hard on the best way to figure out how to tell the highest number of times in a row a number repeated.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: learned more bootstrap layout more intensely, helped a friend get his setInterval() commands working.  displayed the trivia game page using mostly bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Still really struggling with bootstrap, however javascript is feeling very strong these days.  (i did struggle with reusing my recursive shuffle method in a different situation)

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added logic to the trivia game + cool popup displays, real time stats, and cycling through questions when right or wrong, as well as a user select option to determine difficulty and category

**Thoughts:** bootstrap getting stronger, game logic still not as good as it could be.  i want to make a constructor object that will save an ended game, and at the end of the player experience, show all kinds of stats
