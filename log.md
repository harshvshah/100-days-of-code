# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1:  January 1st, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Wrote an algorithm to convert a base 10 number into a binary number.  It prints it as a string, calculates the highest streak of '1's in a row, and re-outputs the base-10 number using calculations to make sure it was done correctly.  
**Thoughts**:  All of it happens in the console right now, but I am hoping to add a visual display next.  I struggled hard on the best way to figure out how to tell the highest number of times in a row a number repeated.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: learned more bootstrap layout more intensely, helped a friend get his setInterval() commands working.  displayed the trivia game page using mostly bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Still really struggling with bootstrap, however javascript is feeling very strong these days.  (i did struggle with reusing my recursive shuffle method in a different situation)

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added logic to the trivia game + cool popup displays, real time stats, and cycling through questions when right or wrong, as well as a user select option to determine difficulty and category

**Thoughts:** bootstrap getting stronger, game logic still not as good as it could be.  i want to make a constructor object that will save an ended game, and at the end of the player experience, show all kinds of stats

### Day 4: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished the basic working version of trivia

**Thoughts:** need to work on mobile responsiveness.  also, need to add a check if the gif or question doesn't load properly

### Day 5: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: bootcamp thursday night class.  integrated OMDB API to display movie posters and movie info.  made a small app using OpenWeather API as well to show local weather of a certain location.  also tidied up the trivia app for mobile responsiveness and to check for content that fails to load.

**Thoughts:** APIs are king.  Added to the list now are:
- integrating a google maps API
- using the google geolocation API
- using the spotify API
- using the Twitter API to automatically tweet something
End Goal:  Integrate a google maps API, that when you click on it you can get geolocation and weather data for the place you clicked on.

### Day 5: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: mini-hackathon with other bootcampers usign HTML5 Canvas for the first time - made a space invader run around the screen and shoot a laser out of his head (lol)

**Thoughts:** 
I would like to add integrating canvas into my RPG game to the list of things to do.
APIs are STILL king.  Added to the list now are:
- integrating a google maps API
- using the google geolocation API

### Day 9: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a mobile-responsive giphy search engine that randomly returns results.
Also added marker info windows to weather clicker app.  Added conditions to change the background image of the weather clicker app to reflect the weather conditions of the place you previously clicked on.

### Day 10: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued to integrate APIs into practical use.
Created a New York Times article search query, returning 5 article results that are clickable, and searchable.
***Notes:
It is sometimes more difficult to work in a team when tasks aren't delegated properly.  

### Day 11: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added google maps API to our meetup page.  Began reformatting my portfolio into a responsive single page design.  Also helped come up with curriculum for our first meetup session.

### Day 12: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to easily translate base 10 numbers into binary.
Made additions to the meetup responsive site.
Introduction to local storage, session storage, and cookies in javascript.  Made a to do list app that uses local storage to keep track of tasks!
Notes:
Local storage takes only strings, can store more data than cookies.  Cookies have an expiration date.  Session storage only lasts while the tab/window is open.

### Day 13: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not a ton of hard coding today, no actual pushes to github.  Worked on a codewars challenge to change it up a bit - still haven't gotten it yet.  It is a task to find all possibilities of combinations of numbers.  [1,2,3,4,5] has 5^5 possibilities, but how do I find them all without repeating??  Tough stuff!
Also, embarked on the journey to create a home base server today.  Succeeded in installing linux ubuntu server 16.04 on an old laptop, and got the LAMP stack installed.  Actually uploaded a few files to an apache2 server.  I now have my own personal "Google Drive".  Can't wait to actually get it hosting my websites.(At least a few of them)  
Notes:
I forgot to push to github today, and it looks like I broke my streak :(

### Day 14: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Saturday class day! Lots of coding.  Learned to use and integrate firebase to do the following:
- keep track of variables forever
- able to be altered and displayed on a web page dynamically (live)
- able to store and edit objects with javascript
- able to receive form data
- able to monitor the number of people currently connect/watching the web page
Cool stuff!

Notes:  Led a presentation in the Web Development class today where I taught the entire class a "better" way to utilize in class exercises.  [git pull] the content from the GitLab so that you can have a directory tree in your text editor already, then pull it up and go!  People liked it and responded well!

### Day 15: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added firebase form data to our website for the meetup.  We went live with the meetup signup page and got a lot of initial interest!  Also embarked on learning C# today on top of javascript.  Wrote my first calculator application in the console (nothing fancy).
